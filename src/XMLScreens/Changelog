Date: May 20
	Mostly integrated with new versions of  GLVisualize,  AbstractGPUArray, 
	      GeometryTypes,ColorType
	Improved treatment of tag <rotateModel>
	Added tags for synchronisation based on signals (Reactive.jl), tested
	Added tests
Date: May 10
	Moved to version of Julia 0.4 requiring new Tuple type syntax
	Moved to GLVisualize,  AbstractGPUArray, GeometryTypes,ColorTypes
	Reorganized Romeo directories
	Tested basic program
	Features added in XML, including julia inlining in xml processing instructions
        First graphic output from XML specifications
	
Date: around May 5
    Reorganised src directories pertaining to subscreen/xml extensions. These
	modules are now inserted in LOAD_PATH.
    Improvement in XML/XSD validation using xmllint
    Transition to new features of Julia 0.4 incompatible with previous syntax (Tuple types)
	
Date: Fri Apr 24 2015
    Added a XML screen/subscreen description facility; improved functionality
	in the area of inter subscreen communication (connector/connection).
	Using LightXML.jl, and various editors/validators for xsd; however
	XML validation needs improvement, diagnostics during XML parsing
	also need improvement.

        Integrated with upstream commit, enables 3Dplots
	
Date: Sat Apr 11 22:55:23 2015 +0200
    Adding functionality: camera movement in one subscreen follows a different
	 subscreen ; progress towards implementing a more general facility
	 (Adaptor) permitting to feed one subscreen signals into a different one.

Date: Mon Apr 6 18:55:44 2015 +0200
    Adding interface to effect geometrical (and possibly other) transformations
	on RenderObject or their presentation by OGL.
	Using 2 techniques: 
	    -camera (in Screen...)
	    -RenderObject (added field manipVirtuals ... not used at the moment)
	Currently works for cube(own RO construction), plot of 2D 
	function ( as provided  with Romeo).

	Issues: Problem when trying to visualize plot of 3D data field (
	        error in renderloop)

    Modularized RomeoLib
    SubsScreens reimplemented for hierachical subscreen model, 
        previous version now called SimpleSubScreens. Additional functionality
        and extensible framework (attrib in SubScreens permit to add various
        set up operations; will try to implement first (not for this commit):
           - shared view parameters between subscreens (dynamic, one view follows the other)
           - derived view parameters (static):subscreen shows a fix view of other subscreen
           - derived view parameters (dynamic√†
           - time dependent display

    Able to display raw OGL with shader programs
    Track GLFW/OpenGL operations, implement a debugging facility (also in 
    GLAbstraction and GLWindow)

Date:   Mon Mar 16 21:13:01 2015 +0100
    Relies on several mods by Sdanisch <sdanisch@gmail.com> (Romeo, GLXX..)
    Operate in Julia 0.3 and 0.4
    Subscreen grid implemented
    RomeoLib  now incorporates standardized procedures, will evolve into library
    RomeoLib moves to src/docUtil

Date:   Sat Mar 14 18:12:53 2015 +0100
    Added signal's library (facilitate use of Reactive)

Date:   Thu Mar 5 14:37:58 2015 +0100
    Added DocCompat package, so that @doc may be used with versions 0.3 (discard doc)
    and 0.4(full function)
